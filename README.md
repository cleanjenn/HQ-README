# Description 

I used a command-line application: Node.js, to dynamically generate a professional README file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The README file is then displayed in a separate file directory that is located [Here](./Develop/dist/README.md)

The full video showing functionality of the appliication creating a README can be accesed via this link:
